    "descP2": "During a trimester break in June 2021, I was eager to expand my knowledge and explore new skills. Given my passion for coding, I researched various resources and stumbled upon freeCodeCamp. I immediately began learning more about web development, particularly NextJS, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. These languages have captured my interest, and I have been actively building my skills in them ever since."
